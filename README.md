# Coronavirus: Firms urged to honour living wage pledge

In April 2020 the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52110652) hundreds of thousands of key workers considered critical to the UK’s response to the coronavirus crisis were earning below the so-called “real living wage”.

The real living wage is a voluntary scheme devised by the Living Wage Foundation.  It is calculated independently from the government and is based on costs such as food, clothing and household bills. 

One in five UK employees earn below the Living Wage Foundation rates, including hundreds of thousands of key workers including hospital cleaners and porters, teaching assistants and carers.

The GMB union said the coronavirus crisis had shone a light on the “rock-bottom pay” of the people “expected to risk their health to protect us”. 

Economists, however, urged against further wage rises before the full toll of the crisis was clear.
